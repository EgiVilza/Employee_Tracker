# Employee_Tracker

## Description

This project demonstrates an employee management system that has the functionality to view, add, and remove 
employees / departments / roles through the use of mysql and npm inquirer. 
Three tables are created in the mysql database (employees / departments / roles)
and foreign keys are used to display the relationship of the employee with the manager, department, and role.
