# Employee_Tracker

## Description

This project is to demonstrate a employee management system that has the functionality to view, add, and remove employees/departments/roles through the use of mysql and npm inquirer (by using the console terminal). Three tables are created in the mysql database (employees/departments/roles) and foreign keys are used to display the relationship of the employee with the manager, department, and role.
